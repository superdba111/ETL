AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy for users to prepare and load their data for analytics. When you're designing a Glue job, there are several steps and considerations to keep in mind:

### 1. Identify Data Sources:
Firstly, you'll need to identify your data sources. Data can be in various AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, and Amazon Redshift, or in your on-premises databases.

### 2. Define AWS Glue Data Catalog:
AWS Glue can discover and catalog metadata about your data stored in data stores. The AWS Glue Data Catalog is an index to the location, schema, and runtime metrics of your data. You define a database, which is a set of associated Data Catalog tables that define the schema for your data.

### 3. Choose a Job Type:
AWS Glue supports various types of ETL jobs. You can write your jobs in Python or Scala. You can also choose between a Glue ETL job or a Glue streaming ETL job, depending on your use case.

### 4. Implement the ETL Script:
You can start with an auto-generated ETL script, and modify it as needed. AWS Glue generates code that's customizable, reusable, and portable. Once your ETL job is defined, you can run it on-demand, or you can set it up to start when a specified trigger occurs. The script libraries provide a set of high-level constructs that encapsulate the lower-level details needed to read, write, transform, and process data.

### 5. Configure Job Properties:
This involves defining data sources and destinations, data formats, defining a temporary directory, and allocating capacity measures like Data Processing Units (DPUs).

### 6. Handling Transformations:
AWS Glue supports both simple and complex transformations. Simple transformations include renaming field names or casting fields to a different type. More complex transformations can be achieved using built-in transforms provided by AWS Glue or by using custom Python code.

### 7. Error Handling:
Design your job to handle potential errors. This can include retries, logging errors, handling bad input data, etc.

### 8. Monitoring and Logging:
You should also plan to monitor your AWS Glue jobs. AWS Glue integrates with Amazon CloudWatch Logs to enable centralized operational logging, and with Amazon CloudWatch Metrics for real-time operational metrics.

### 9. Security:
You also need to consider the security aspect of your ETL jobs. Make sure you're following best practices for IAM roles and policies, and using encryption for sensitive data.

### 10. Scheduling and Orchestration:
For more complex ETL workflows, you can use triggers in AWS Glue or use AWS Step Functions for more advanced workflows.

Remember, designing your AWS Glue jobs involves understanding your data and your desired outcome, and then iteratively developing, debugging, and testing your job until it's doing what you need. Each use case will have different requirements and might need a different approach.
