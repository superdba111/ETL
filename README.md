informatica/ODI/Pendaho/Talend/Tableau Pre

I ever used all of them in the different years in the companies, Did Exercises and posted them on their folder

Tableau Prep can do the following, Data clean, combine, aggregate, workflow, pivot, union, join, filter etc. This Feb(2018) I gave my feedback to Tableau Beta support on no rep and JVM performance issue for large data etc, suggestions--the user can turn off/on some calculations like data distribution etc

Besides aboves, all ETL/ELT tool can do lookup, router, sorter, rank, data validation etc.

tried other ETL tools like datastage, babelway, boomi but gave them up
