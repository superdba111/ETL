# ETL/ELT
informatica/ODI/Pendaho/Talend/Tableau Prep

I ever used all of them in the different years in the companies, Did Exercises and posted them on their folder

Tableau Prep can do the following, Data clean, combine, aggregate, workflow, pivot, union, join, filter etc. This Feb(2018) I gave my feedback to Tableau Beta support on no rep and JVM performance issue for large data etc, suggestions--the user can turn off/on some calculations like data distribution etc

Besides aboves, all ETL/ELT tool can do lookup, router, sorter, rank, data validation etc.

tried other ETL tools like datastage, babelway, boomi but gave them up

Python with Airflow ETL is located in DS folder, here are all tools 

Here are some checklist for your ETL testing plan,

#3 Data Completeness: ensures that all the data from the source are loaded into the target destination.
#3 Data Correctness: ensures that all the data is accurately transformed and loaded from the source to the target destination.
#3 Performance Testing: ensures if an ETL system can handle an expected load of multiple users and transactions.
#3 Metadata Testing: checks whether data retains its integrity up to the metadata level, It involves validating the source and the target table structure w.r.t. the mapping document. The mapping document contains all the fields that define the structure of tables in the source and the target systems like length, data type, index etc.
#3 Syntax Testing: checks for poor data due to invalid characters and incorrect character cases.
#3 Data Validation: checks whether the values of the data post-transformation are the same as their expected values with respect to the the source values.
